# Mkdocs

Mkdocs is used as the site generator to automatically generate the Pages documentation for the repo. There are a few options which can be chosen in terms of where the document markdowns are stored and how they are generated, but the most straightforward method is to create a `docs` folder. Customization of these options is set by `mkdocs.yml`.
