# Modular GitLab-CI

## Usage

A collection of stackable `.gitlab-ci.yml` templates for modular construction of GitLab-CI pipelines.

In many cases, including functionality is as easy as an include clause in a project's `.gitlab-ci.yml`. These templates are designed to be simple, intuitive, and as auto-magical as possible.

## Benefits

- [x] Faster pipeline development and runs
- [x] Pipeline debugging options
- [x] Increased consistency among projects
- [x] Optimized performance
- [x] Pipelines can be altered and adapted quickly
- [x] Security (Vault Integration)
