# Modular GitLab-CI

General, reusable, stackable templates for a variety of functions specifically built for use in GitLab-CI pipelines.

## Benefits

- [X] Reduced code repetition
- [X] Faster development
- [X] Pipeline debugging
- [X] increased consistency among projects
- [X] Optimized performance
- [X] Pipelines can be altered and adapted quickly
- [X] Security (Vault Integration)

## How it works

In many cases, including functionality is as easy as an include clause in a project's .gitlab-ci.yml. These templates are designed to be simple, intuitive, and as auto-magical as possible.

!!! note
    This library includes a wide range of functionality, and will be expanded over time.

## Example

--8<-- “lint/shell.md”

    This is a living document, and sometimes life is messy.
