# GitLab-CI Templates

## About

A collection of stackable `.gitlab-ci.yml` templates for modular construction of GitLab-CI pipelines.

In many cases, including functionality is as easy as an include clause in a project's `.gitlab-ci.yml`. These templates are designed to be simple, intuitive, and as auto-magical as possible.
